\begin{abstract}
Hand Prostheses are an important research topic because these prostheses can improve the quality of life of amputees. The main goal in the design and development of prosthetic hands is to reach a high level of acceptance of the prostheses by potential users. Therefore the hand should look anthropomorphic and be rather lightweight while still enabling the user to do many different grasps with enough force and in short time without too much effort of the user. Another important factor is to keep the prosthetic hands as low-cost as possible to make them affordable for a lot of people.\\
In this paper different hand prostheses which were published in the last few years will be described and compared with regard to various properties like weight, size and degrees of freedom as well as kinematics, mechanics and sensor systems. Additionally special features of the different prosthetic hands will be elaborated.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Hand Prostheses}

\subsection{SSSA-MyHand}

The MyHand was developed by the BioRobotics Institute of the SSSA and published in 2016. The goal was to design a dexterous lightweight hand prosthesis as an alternative to clinically available multi-grasp prostheses while using low-cost manufacturing processes and components wherever possible. To reduce complexity the hand carries three identical 8W brushless DC motors, one for the thumb, one for the index finger and one for the other three fingers. The functional components are hold together by a thin plate surrounded by a 3D-printed metallic mainframe and plastic covers for protection. The hand contains a sensory system for automatic grasp control and makes a future integration of a sensory feedback system possible, e.g. touch sensors in the fingertips. The motors are controlled by the master microcontroller which also acquires the EMG singals and communicates with the external world. The master microcontroller gains information about the actual speed and position of the motors from the slave microcontroller.\\
The force exerted at the fingertips is on average 31.4 N for the thumb, 11.7 N for the index finger and between 9.4 N and 14.6 for the other three fingers. The flexion/extension speed is 160 $^\circ$/s for the thumb and 170 $^\circ$/s for the other fingers, while the speed of the thumb while switching from the opposition to the reposition state can reach 250 $^\circ$/s. The time needed to complete a grasp starting from the rest position is 270 ms for a lateral grasp and 370 ms for a cylindrical grasp.


\subsection{AstoHand v.1}

The AstoHand v.1 was developed by the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Diponegoro University. They focused on designing a low-cost anthropomorphic prosthetic hand which uses DC micro metal gear motors and 3D-printed material to make it lightweight. The developed hand has five degrees of freedom and each finger contains two joints and one motor. The five DoFs were chosen because they are sufficient for the most important activities of daily living while reducing the complexity of the mechanical design and manufacturing costs. For the movement of the fingers the motors are connected to the joints via a tendon-spring mechanism. The five DC motors are placed in the palm, an Arduino Nano microcontroller and driver motor are placed in the back cover and two batteries, with voltage of 3.7 V and capacity of 2425 mAh, are placed in the socket of the hand.

\subsection{Bionic Hand}

The Bionic Hand is a hybrid actuated prosthetic hand with 24 DoFs developed by the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the Bogazici University and the Department of Mechatronic Engineering of the Marmara University. For the design of the prosthesis the human hand is used as reference with all its joints and connections. Neural Networks are used to classify the EMG signals as well as to control the actuators which include brushless DC motors and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators. The two types of actuators are used to imitate extrinsic and intrinsic muscles and to emulate the antagonistic contraction. Overall there are 13 motors placed in the forearm, four motor pairs for the flexion and extension of the four fingers, two motors for the flexion-extension and abduction-adduction of the wrist and three motors for controlling the thumb. The SMA actuators are placed on the sides of the metacarpals and are used for the abduction-adduction of the fingers. While they are slow and not strong they are good to imitate the rather weak intrinsic muscles because of their low weight and small size.

\subsection{X-Hand}

The X-Hand is an anthropomorphic prosthetic hand with size similar to the human hand designed by the Institute of Rehabilitation and Medical Robotics of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The goal was to design a hand prosthesis which fulfills the following three important features. The hand should have anthropomorphic grasp functions to cover the grasping activities of daily living, few actuators to reduce complexity and easier control and a compact structure with integrated hardware for a flexible installation and convenient wearing for the user.\\
The thumb mechanism of the X-Hand is designed independently of the mechanism of the other fingers to enable the thumb to move independently during grasping like in the human hand. Two DC motors are used for the kinematic transmission system of the four fingers to generate anthropomorphic grasping movements and two DC motors are used for the movement of the thumb. The time needed to close the hand from open is 1.2 s. The grasping force measured during contact with a cylinder between thumb and index finger is 12.1 N. This grasping force is not limited due to the hand construction but rather by the motor size.
